## Limitations
- **Geographical limitations:** Data is available only at the county level. This may mask more localized disparities within counties.
- **Data accuracy:** The data is based on estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS), which has inherent sampling errors. Small counties may have greater margins of error.
- **Missing data:** There may be gaps for some counties or variables in certain years.
- **Changes in classification:** Some categories may change over time (e.g., ethnicity or housing types), making it difficult to compare across all years without considering these changes.
- **Time lag:** Data for 2023 may not be as complete or accurate as earlier years, depending on the survey timeline.
