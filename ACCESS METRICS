Healthcare facility access metrics

Data Location:  
You can find the variables described in this document in the CSV files https://uofi.box.com/s/zb9beahqrzxwsfagk9va0z54bt55kb8n.  

CSV files are organized by ZCTA (ZIP Code Tabulation Area). Each row represents a 2020 ZCTA with a calculated distance to the nearest OTP.  

Data Source(s) Description:  
Facility locations of Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) were sourced from the [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)](https://findtreatment.gov/) and cleaned for analysis. OTPs are certified to administer and dispense FDA-approved medications for opioid use disorder (OUD), including methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. These facilities also provide counseling and behavioral health therapies, forming part of the Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) approach.

ZCTA boundary files were sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau, 2020 TIGER/Line Shapefiles.

Description of Data Source Tables:  
The raw OTP dataset includes facility name, address, state, ZIP code, phone number, services offered, and geocoded coordinates (latitude and longitude).  

Description of Data Processing:

**Tract and Zip Code**  
*Distance*  
Centroids were calculated for ZCTA geometries. For each centroid, the minimum Euclidean distance in miles was calculated to the nearest OTP location. This metric is used as a proxy for geographic access to treatment.  

**Script/Method**:  
Analysis was conducted in Python using geopandas and shapely. Script available in `code/access_otp_distance.py` (or your repo path).

Key Variable and Definitions:

| Field Name     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ZCTA5CE20`    | 5-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area code (2020)                                |
| `GEOID20`      | Unique geographic identifier (same as ZCTA5CE20)                            |
| `CLASSFP20`    | Class code for ZCTA (`B5` = ZIP Code Tabulation Area)                       |
| `MTFCC20`      | MAF/TIGER Feature Class Code (`G6350` = ZCTA5)                              |
| `FUNCSTAT20`   | Functional status of the ZCTA (`S` = Significant area)                      |
| `ALAND20`      | Land area in square meters                                                  |
| `AWATER20`     | Water area in square meters                                                 |
| `INTPTLAT20`   | Latitude of the internal point (centroid) of the ZCTA                       |
| `INTPTLON20`   | Longitude of the internal point (centroid) of the ZCTA                      |
| `minDist_mi`   | Minimum distance (in miles) from ZCTA centroid to the nearest OTP facility  |

Data Limitations:  
* The `otpMinDis` variable uses Euclidean (straight-line) distance from centroid to facility. It does not account for road networks, travel times, or real-world geographic barriers.
* ZCTA centroids are geometric, not population-weighted.
* OTP dataset reflects facility availability as of the date of download; it may not capture newly opened or closed facilities.

Comments/Notes:  
This dataset covers all ZCTAs in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. It does not include U.S. territories or other outlying areas.
