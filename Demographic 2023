### Description of Data Processing:  
- Percentage values represent proportions of the total population or household population and are rounded to two decimal places.  
- Average household size is expressed in number of persons.  
- Median age is measured in years.  
- All race variables follow ACS definitions, including "Two or More Races," which includes individuals selecting multiple race options on the ACS survey.
