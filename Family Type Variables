**Note:** Every variable can be found in the **Latest** files.

### Data Source(s) Description:  
Variables were obtained from the *American Community Survey (ACS)* 5-Year Estimates for the years 2020 and 2023, primarily from tables DP05 (Demographic and Housing Estimates) and S1101 (Households and Families), at the Tract, County, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels.

The ACS is conducted annually by the U.S. Census Bureau and provides key demographic and socioeconomic indicators at multiple geographic scales.

### Description of Data Source Tables:  
**Table DP05:** Demographic and Housing Estimates  
**Table S1101:** Households and Families  

These tables provide estimates related to household and family structures, average household/family size, gender distribution, and median age. Percentages were calculated based on total household or family populations, depending on context.

### Description of Data Processing:  
- Average values such as household and family size are reported in number of persons.  
- Gender and family type variables are expressed as percentages of the total population or total households.  
- Median age is reported in years.  
- All percentage values are on a 0–100 scale and rounded to two decimal places.

### Data Limitations:  
- ACS estimates are subject to sampling variability and margins of error.  
- Small-area estimates (e.g., tract-level) may have higher uncertainty.  
- ZCTA data is only available for the most recent ACS years (2020 and 2023).  
- Gender categories are limited to binary classifications (male/female) based on ACS standards.

For detailed definitions and methodology, refer to the [ACS Subject Definitions](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html).  
When comparing across years or geographic units, be aware of shifts in population base and definitions over time.
