## Theme:
Demographics and Socioeconomics

## Data Location:
The variables described in this document can be found in the CSV files in box.

CSV files are organized by year and geographic identifier (GEOID). Each row represents a geographic unit (e.g., census tract, ZCTA) and contains associated socioeconomic indicators.

## Data Source(s) Description:
The data were sourced from the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey (ACS) and related products, aggregated for internal analysis purposes.

## Description of Data Source Tables:
The dataset includes raw and derived estimates of housing conditions, employment status, income, poverty, educational attainment, veteran status, and disability rates.

Each record includes a unique geographic identifier (`GEOID`), the year of data collection, and multiple socioeconomic metrics.

## Description of Data Processing:
Minimal processing was conducted beyond standardizing variable names and ensuring numeric consistency. Missing values are marked as `NA`.

Indicators such as unemployment rates, income measures, household types, and demographic breakdowns were directly sourced or calculated using standard Census Bureau methodologies.

## Data Limitations:

- Missing data is marked as `NA` and should be considered carefully in analysis.
- Variables sourced from ACS data represent 5-year estimates where applicable, not single-year snapshots.

## Comments/Notes:
- This dataset includes geographies within Puerto Rico but may exclude U.S. territories such as Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.
- Users should refer to ACS documentation for detailed methodology on variable calculation and definitions.
