## Theme:
Demographics and Socioeconomics

## Data Location:
The variables described in this document can be found in the CSV files in box.

CSV files are organized by year and geographic identifier (GEOID). Each row represents geographic unit Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) and contains associated socioeconomic indicators.

## Data Source(s) Description:
The data were sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) and related products, aggregated for internal analysis purposes.

## Description of Data Source Tables:
The dataset includes raw and derived estimates of housing conditions, employment status, income, poverty, educational attainment, veteran status, and disability rates.

Each record includes a unique geographic identifier (`GEOID`), the year of data collection, and multiple socioeconomic metrics.

## Description of Data Processing:
Minimal processing was conducted beyond standardizing variable names and ensuring numeric consistency. Missing values are marked as `NA`.

Indicators such as unemployment rates, income measures, household types, and demographic breakdowns were directly sourced or calculated using standard Census Bureau methodologies.
