### Theme:  
Housing – Structure Types, Occupancy, and Crowding

---

### Data Location:  
You can find the variables described in this document in the CSV files here.

CSV files are organized by year and spatial scale. For example, county-level variables from 2020 will be found in `C_2020.csv`.  
**Note:** Every variable can be found in the **Latest** files.

---

### Data Source(s) Description:  
Variables were derived from the *American Community Survey (ACS)* 5-Year Estimates, using tables related to housing occupancy (e.g., B25014, B25024, and B25003), covering the years 2020 and 2023.

The ACS provides detailed housing information for census tracts, counties, and ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs), including data on occupancy, unit type, and crowding.

---

### Description of Data Source Tables:  
**Table B25014:** Tenure by Occupants per Room  
**Table B25024:** Units in Structure  
**Table B25003:** Occupancy Status

These tables measure crowding (more than 1 person per room), housing structure types (e.g., single-family, multi-family, condo), and occupancy rates.

---

### Description of Data Processing:  
- Crowding is defined as more than 1.00 person per room for household members aged 18+.  
- Housing type variables are derived from classification codes based on structural use and zoning descriptions.  
- Mixed-use classifications were identified using supplementary geospatial zoning overlays and structure use flags.  
- All percentage variables represent a share of total housing units or occupied units as appropriate.

### Key Variable and Definitions:

| Variable                          | Variable ID in .csv | Description                                                                 | Years Available | Spatial Scale        |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Crowded Housing (18+)             | crowdHsng18         | Percent of households with crowding (1.01+ persons/room, age 18+)           | 2020, 2023       | Tract, County, ZCTA   |
| Condominium Housing               | HsdTypCo            | Percent of housing classified as condominium                               | 2020, 2023       | Tract, County, ZCTA   |
| Multifamily Housing               | HsdTypM             | Percent of housing classified as multifamily                               | 2020, 2023       | Tract, County, ZCTA   |
| Mixed-Use Housing                 | HsdTypMC            | Percent of housing classified as mixed-use                                 | 2020, 2023       | Tract, County, ZCTA   |
| Occupied Housing Units            | occupantP           | Percent of housing units that are occupied                                 | 2020, 2023       | Tract, County, ZCTA   |

### Data Limitations:  
- Crowding is calculated only for the population age 18+, which differs from ACS’s total household estimates.  
- Mixed-use housing data may be unavailable in some rural or low-density tracts due to geospatial zoning limitations.  
- ZCTA-level data may be suppressed or statistically unreliable in areas with low response counts.  
- Structural classification depends on local zoning interpretation and ACS categorization.
